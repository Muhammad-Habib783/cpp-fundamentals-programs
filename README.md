# C++ Fundamentals Programs

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly C++ programs developed during my first semester of **Programming Fundamentals**. The goal of this project is to strengthen the understanding of core programming concepts through  practical examples and hands-on coding exercises.

By working through these programs, learners can build a solid foundation in C++ and prepare themselves for more advanced topics such as object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms.

## 📚 Topics Covered
The repository includes implementations and examples covering the following fundamental concepts:

- **Variables and Data Types**: Understanding how to store and manipulate information.
- **Conditional Statements**: Using `if/else` and `switch` to make decisions in programs.
- **Loops**: Practicing iteration with `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.
- **Functions**: Writing reusable blocks of code to improve modularity.
- **Arrays and Strings**: Managing collections of data and working with text.
